1. "index.html": This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website. It will include references to the other CSS files ("styles.css" and "tailwind.css"). It will contain the id names of the DOM elements that might be used by potential JavaScript functions.

2. "styles.css": This is the main CSS file that will contain custom styles for the website. It will use class and id selectors that match those in the "index.html" file.

3. "tailwind.css": This is the CSS file for Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. It will be linked in the "index.html" file and will provide styles that can be applied using class names in the HTML.

Shared Dependencies:

1. HTML Element IDs: These are unique identifiers for elements in the "index.html" file. They can be used in the "styles.css" file to apply styles to specific elements, and in potential JavaScript files to manipulate these elements.

2. CSS Class Names: These are identifiers that can be used to apply styles to one or more elements in the "index.html" file. They are defined in both the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files.

3. CSS Selectors: These are used in the "styles.css" file to select and style elements in the "index.html" file. They can be element names, class names, or id names.

4. Link to CSS Files: The "index.html" file will have links to the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files, allowing it to use the styles defined in these files.

5. Tailwind Utility Classes: These are classes provided by the Tailwind CSS framework that can be used in the "index.html" file to apply styles. They are defined in the "tailwind.css" file.
